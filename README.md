# Stocastic-Volatility-with-PyMC-and-OANDA
Using Monte Carlo Markov Chains for Time Series Forecasting 

This is my adoption of the stochastic volatility example from PyMC3 https://docs.pymc.io/en/v3/pymc-examples/examples/case_studies/stochastic_volatility.html. 

If you have ideas to improve the current work do not hesitate to contact me :-D

Cheers and thank you!
