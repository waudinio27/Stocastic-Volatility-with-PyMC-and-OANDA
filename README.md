# Stocastic-Volatility-with-PyMC-and-OANDA
Using Monte Carlo Markov Chains for Time Series Forecasting 

This is my version of the SVL model from the book https://github.com/mfrdixon/ML_Finance_Codes/blob/master/Chapter7-Probabilistic-Sequence-Modeling/ML_in_Finance-Kalman_Filters.ipynb

It is with OANDA broker and uses the package PyMC to calculate the MCMC - Monte Carlo Markov Chain. 

Currently the prediction of the forecast is not ready. So only a posterior estimation is shown. 

If you have ideas to improve the current work do not hesitate to contact me :-D

Cheers and thank you!
